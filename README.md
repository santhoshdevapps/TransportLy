## Test approach

The aim of this framework is to cover main functionalities such as : Already registered user, Forgot password and also create an account. All possible scripts for positive and negative tests are done.

I created this framework with Java, Selenium and TestNG, Maven and structured in a way that no data is left in the application. 

I organized the features in initializing the driver at "base" package, the pages definitions in a repository named "page", the drivers are found in a repository named "resources" and "utils" repository consits of excel spreadsheets to read the test data and also contains test listener(TestNG) to capture pass,fail and skip status and also captures the screenshot and adds it as an execution report in project structure. 

Also, for debug purposes, I included a log feature for each step (saved in "logfile.log"). The test results are automatically generated by TestNG and can be found at "target/surefire-report" folder in HTML format. The data at "testdata" package is recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. At last, all the test cases are found in "testcases" package.

The CI/CD has been achieved using Jenkins and performance test is carried out using JMeter.

# Setup


The project is broken into separate modules for Login, Sign up and Forgot password page

* Clone the repository from git using git clone url command.
* Open the project **PathFactoryAutomationTest** in Eclipse as a maven project using pom.xml

**TestNG Suite**

```
* From Project Explorer, navigate through PathFactoryAutomationTest and run the file "testng.xml" as TestNG Suite;
```
or
**Maven**

```
* From Project Explorer, right click and run as Maven clean
* Proceed with maven install
```
 
**To run using Selenium Grid**

```
To run the hub:

* move to the selenium-grid directory in the terminal
* Type chmod u+x to access permission
* Drag and drop the hubConf.bat file from the barfiles folder and free enter
* Hub will start running 
* Check http://localhost:4444/grid/console

To run nodes

* Open new terminal window
* move to the selenium-grid directory in the terminal
* Type chmod u+x to access permission
* Drag and drop the the following .bat file you want to run test on from the barfiles folder and free enter
* node will start running.
* Check http://localhost:4444/grid/console

Repeat step 2 for all the remaining nodes.
